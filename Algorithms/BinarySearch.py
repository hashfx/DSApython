Binary Search Algorithm
    Search Algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array(ASCE).
    Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
    Normal Zindagi (Linear Search):
        To find an element from a list, compare elements from index[0] till the element is found
    Mentos Zindagi (Binary Search):
        To find an element k from a list:
            > Sort the array in Ascending order
            > Find the middle element from the list
            > Compare it with key to be found
                > If middle element is less than key, find the middle element of the list at right-side of the middle element
                > If middle element is more than key, find the middle element of the list at left-side of the middle element
                > Repeat above 2 steps until the key is found
                > Return index of the key if it is found in the list
                > If key is not found in the list, return -1 or false
        With every iteration, search space is divided by 1/2
            Iteration 1 = n/2
            Iteration 2 = (n/2)/2 = n/2^2
            Iteration 3 = (n/2^2) = n/2^3
            Iteration k = (n/2^k)
                1 = n/2^k
                n = 2^k
                log2(n) = log2(2^k)
                log2(n) = k*log2(2)
                k = log(n)
            Time Complexity: O(log n)
